## Pipe Room

---

We, Tommy Shinest and plac3holdr, have free time to code a lil baby thing.

We are using p5.js to code; this is a first project.

https://p5.js

///

If you wanna run it, put this in your html:

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.6.0/p5.js"></script>

Some of the functions we use are from the library above.

For now we don't have contacts.

///

Issues include:
- incomplete (how?)
  - not playable
  - bloo
  - we dont even know how to use funtions yet
